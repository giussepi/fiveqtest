Goal: Create a simple Django app to manage daily devotionals, and import the supplied CSV file into the database.

Timeline: Return your code by replying to all on this email within 90 minutes.  Return any documentation you wish to provide within the next 30 minutes after your coding is complete.

Deliverables:

1. An original Django application with the following: model.py, admin.py, views.py and urls.py. The view should have a single URL and accept a date and return the matching devotional. The HTML can be very basic.
2. A Python script to import the CSV content into the database.
3. Extra Credit 1: Write a view to calculate the the total number of words in the devotionals.
4. Extra Credit 2: Incorporate Django-tagging into the app: https://github.com/alex/django-taggit
5. Extra Credit 3: Push into a github.com repo and send Five Q the link.

You have 90 minutes to complete the assignment, and then another 30 minutes to provide an optional write up explaining your decision making process.

Go for it!
