devotionals models
  Daily_Devotional: in this model the fields month and day are fields with 
  choices because I think if we are not going to use the year then we don't
  need to use a Date Field.

the function import_csv just import the datafrom the csv file, initially I 
  wrote this funtion in a py file, however I had a problem importing the 
  devotional app (here I lost several minutes) so I decided to include it 
  in the models where everything worked.
